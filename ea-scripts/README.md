|[Connect elements](Connect%20elements.md)|This script will connect two objects with an arrow. If either of the objects are a set of grouped elements (e.g. a text element grouped with an encapsulating rectangle), the script will identify these groups, and connect the arrow to the largest object in the group (assuming you want to connect the arrow to the box around the text element).|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-connect-elements.jpg)|[@zsviczian](https://github.com/zsviczian)|

Essentially converts text element into a wrappable format.|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-textelement-to-transparent-stickynote.png)|[@zsviczian](https://github.com/zsviczian)|

|[Darken background color](Darken%20background%20color.md)|This script darkens the background color of the selected element by 2% at a time. You can use this script several times until you are satisfied. It is recommended to set a shortcut key for this script so that you can quickly try to DARKEN and LIGHTEN the color effect. In contrast to the `Modify background color opacity` script, the advantage is that the background color of the element is not affected by the canvas color, and the color value does not appear in a strange rgba() form.|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/darken-lighten-background-color.png)|[@1-2-3](https://github.com/1-2-3)|

|[Fixed spacing](Fixed%20spacing.md)|The script arranges the selected elements horizontally with a fixed spacing. When we create an architecture diagram or mind map, we often need to arrange a large number of elements in a fixed spacing. `Fixed spacing` and `Fixed vertical Distance` scripts can save us a lot of time.|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-fix-space-demo.png)|[@1-2-3](https://github.com/1-2-3)|
|[Fixed vertical distance between centers](Fixed%20vertical%20distance%20between%20centers.md)|This script arranges the selected elements vertically with a fixed center spacing.|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-fixed-vertical-distance-between-centers.png)|[@1-2-3](https://github.com/1-2-3)|

|[Lighten background color](Lighten%20background%20color.md)|This script lightens the background color of the selected element by 2% at a time. You can use this script several times until you are satisfied. It is recommended to set a shortcut key for this script so that you can quickly try to DARKEN and LIGHTEN the color effect.In contrast to the `Modify background color opacity` script, the advantage is that the background color of the element is not affected by the canvas color, and the color value does not appear in a strange rgba() form.|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/darken-lighten-background-color.png)|[@1-2-3](https://github.com/1-2-3)|
|[Modify background color opacity](Modify%20background%20color%20opacity.md)|This script changes the opacity of the background color of the selected boxes. The default background color in Excalidraw is so dark that the text is hard to read. You can lighten the color a bit by setting transparency. And you can tweak the transparency over and over again until you're happy with it. Although excalidraw has the opacity option in its native property Settings, it also changes the transparency of the border. Use this script to change only the opacity of the background color without affecting the border.|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-modify-background-color-opacity.png)|[@1-2-3](https://github.com/1-2-3)|

|[Organic Line](Organic%20Line.md)|Converts selected freedraw lines such that pencil pressure will decrease from maximum to minimum from the beginning of the line to its end.

|[Repeat Elements](Repeat%20Elements.md)|This script will detect the difference between 2 selected elements, including position, size, angle, stroke and background color, and create several elements that repeat these differences based on the number of repetitions entered by the user.|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/master/images/scripts-repeat-elements.png)|[@1-2-3](https://github.com/1-2-3)|
